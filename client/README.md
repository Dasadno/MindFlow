Architecture is based on: 
  Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) - https://feature-sliced.design/ (read about it)
1. Shared layer. This layer which contains reusable components, hooks, utils, etc. This layer provides a common interface without any functionality.
2. Features layer. This layer contains the business logic and functionality of the application and is responsible for the application's core functionality.
3. Widgets layer. This layer composes components from the shared layer and the features layer into reusable components with businesss logic.
4. Pages layer. This layer is responsible for the application's pages, it's just the structure of the pages.
5. App layer. This layer is responsible for the application's configuration, its routes, global stules, providers etc.
